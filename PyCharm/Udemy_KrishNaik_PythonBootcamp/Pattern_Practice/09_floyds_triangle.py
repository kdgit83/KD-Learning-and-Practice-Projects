    """
    Function to return the first n rows of Floyd's Triangle as a list of strings.

    Parameters:
    n (int): The number of rows in the triangle.

    Returns:
    list: A list of strings where each string represents a row of Floyd's Triangle.

    Problem Description:
    You are given an integer n. Your task is to return the first n rows of Floydâ€™s Triangle, represented as a list of
    strings. Floyd's Triangle is a triangular array of natural numbers where the first row contains 1, the second row
    contains 2 and 3, the third row contains 4, 5, and 6, and so on.

    Example:
    Input: 5
    Output: ['1', '2 3', '4 5 6', '7 8 9 10', '11 12 13 14 15']

    Input: 3
    Output: ['1', '2 3', '4 5 6']
